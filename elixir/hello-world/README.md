# Hello World

The classical introductory exercise.
Just say "Hello, World!".

The objectives are simple:

- Modify the provided code so that it produces the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.

## Running the tests

From the terminal, change to the base directory of the exercise then execute the tests with:

```bash
$ mix test
```

This will execute the test file found in the `test` subfolder -- a file ending in `_test.exs`

If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.
